This repository:
- was forked from [FL-paper-update-tracker](https://github.com/youngfish42/FL-paper-update-tracker/tree/main).
- is based on [dblp-watcher](https://github.com/beiyuouo/dblp-watcher/). 
- uses [DBLP API](https://dblp.org/faq/How+to+use+the+dblp+search+API.html) to search papers and construct a paper update tracker for multi/many-task optimization papers.
